Feature: enforce the restricted special characters in a password on the public share link page

  As an administrator
  I want public share link passwords to always contain some of a restricted list of special characters
  So that users cannot set passwords that have unusual hard-to-type characters

  Background:
    Given the administrator has enabled the special characters password policy
    And the administrator has set the special characters required to "3"
    And the administrator has enabled the restrict to these special characters password policy
    And the administrator has set the restricted special characters required to "$%^&*"
    And these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username | password   |
      | user1    | a$b%c^1234 |
    And the user has browsed to the login page
    And the user has logged in with username "user1" and password "a$b%c^1234" using the webUI

  Scenario Outline: user creates a public share link with enough restricted special characters
    When the user creates a new public link for folder "simple-folder" using the webUI with
      | password | <password> |
    And the public accesses the last created public link with password "<password>" using the webUI
    Then file "lorem.txt" should be listed on the webUI
    Examples:
      | password              |
      | 3$Special%Characters^ |
      | 1*2&3^4%5$6           |

  Scenario Outline: user tries to create a link with too few restricted special characters
    When the user tries to create a new public link for folder "simple-folder" using the webUI with
      | password | <password> |
    Then the user should see an error message on the public link share dialog saying "The password contains too few special characters. At least 3 special characters ($%^&*) are required."
    And the public link should not have been generated
    Examples:
      | password                 |
      | NoSpecialCharacters123   |
      | Only2$Special&Characters |

  Scenario Outline: user tries to create a public share link with invalid special characters
    When the user tries to create a new public link for folder "simple-folder" using the webUI with
      | password | <password> |
    Then the user should see an error message on the public link share dialog saying "The password contains invalid special characters. Only $%^&* are allowed."
    And the public link should not have been generated
    Examples:
      | password                                 |
      | Only#Invalid!Special@Characters          |
      | 1*2&3^4%5$6andInvalidSpecialCharacters#! |
