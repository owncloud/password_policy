Feature: enforce the required number of uppercase letters in a password on public share links

  As an administrator
  I want public share link passwords to always contain a required number of uppercase letters
  So that users cannot set passwords that are too easy to guess

  Background:
    Given the administrator has enabled the uppercase letters password policy
    And the administrator has set the uppercase letters required to "3"
    And these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username | password   |
      | user1    | abcABC1234 |
    And user "user1" has created a public link share with settings
      | path     | welcome.txt |
      | password | ABCabc1234  |

  Scenario Outline: user updates the public share link password to a string with enough uppercase letters
    When user "user1" updates the last share using the sharing API with
      | password | <password> |
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the last public shared file should be able to be downloaded with password "<password>"
    And the last public shared file should not be able to be downloaded with password "ABCabc1234"
    Examples:
      | password                  |
      | 3UpperCaseLetters         |
      | MoreThan3UpperCaseLetters |

  Scenario Outline: user tries to update the public share link password to a string that has too few uppercase letters
    When user "user1" tries to update the last share using the sharing API with
      | password | <password> |
    Then the OCS status message should be "The password contains too few uppercase letters. At least 3 uppercase letters are required."
    And the OCS status code should be "400"
    And the last public shared file should be able to be downloaded with password "ABCabc1234"
    And the last public shared file should not be able to be downloaded with password "<password>"
    Examples:
      | password       |
      | 0uppercase     |
      | Only2Uppercase |
