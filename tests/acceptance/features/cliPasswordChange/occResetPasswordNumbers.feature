Feature: enforce the required number of numbers in a password when resetting the password using the occ command

  As an administrator
  I want user passwords to always contain a required number of numbers
  So that users cannot set passwords that are too easy to guess

  Background:
    Given the administrator has enabled the numbers password policy
    And the administrator has set the numbers required to "3"
    And these users have been created with default attributes and skeleton files:
      | username | password   |
      | user1    | abcABC1234 |

  Scenario Outline: admin resets the password of a user with a password that has enough numbers
    When the administrator resets the password of user "user1" to "<password>" using the occ command
    Then the command should have been successful
    And the command output should contain the text 'Successfully reset password for user1'
    And the content of file "textfile0.txt" for user "user1" using password "<password>" should be "ownCloud test text file 0" plus end-of-line
    But user "user1" using password "abcABC1234" should not be able to download file "textfile0.txt"
    Examples:
      | password        |
      | 333Numbers      |
      | moreNumbers1234 |

  Scenario Outline: admin resets the password of a user with a password that does not have enough numbers
    When the administrator resets the password of user "user1" to "<password>" using the occ command
    Then the command should have failed with exit code 1
    And the command error output should contain the text 'The password contains too few numbers. At least 3 numbers are required.'
    And the content of file "textfile0.txt" for user "user1" using password "abcABC1234" should be "ownCloud test text file 0" plus end-of-line
    But user "user1" using password "<password>" should not be able to download file "textfile0.txt"
    Examples:
      | password      |
      | NoNumbers     |
      | Only22Numbers |
