Feature: enforce combinations of password policies when changing a user password

  As an administrator
  I want user passwords to always have some combination of minimum length, lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters
  So that users cannot set passwords that are too easy to guess

  Background:
    Given the administrator has enabled the minimum characters password policy
    And the administrator has set the minimum characters required to "15"
    And the administrator has enabled the lowercase letters password policy
    And the administrator has set the lowercase letters required to "4"
    And the administrator has enabled the uppercase letters password policy
    And the administrator has set the uppercase letters required to "3"
    And the administrator has enabled the numbers password policy
    And the administrator has set the numbers required to "2"
    And the administrator has enabled the special characters password policy
    And the administrator has set the special characters required to "3"
    And these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username | password        |
      | user1    | aA1!bB2#cC&deee |

  Scenario Outline: admin changes a user password to one that meets the password policy
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    When user "admin" sends HTTP method "PUT" to OCS API endpoint "/cloud/users/user1" with body
      | key   | password   |
      | value | <password> |
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the content of file "textfile0.txt" for user "user1" using password "<password>" should be "ownCloud test text file 0" plus end-of-line
    But user "user1" using password "aA1!bB2#cC&deee" should not be able to download file "textfile0.txt"
    Examples:
      | password                  | ocs-api-version | ocs-status |
      | 15***UPPloweZZZ           | 1               | 100        |
      | 15***UPPloweZZZ           | 2               | 200        |
      | More%Than$15!Characters-0 | 1               | 100        |
      | More%Than$15!Characters-0 | 2               | 200        |

  Scenario Outline: admin changes a user password to one that does not meet the password policy
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs-api-version>"
    When user "admin" sends HTTP method "PUT" to OCS API endpoint "/cloud/users/user1" with body
      | key   | password   |
      | value | <password> |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "<http-status>"
    And the HTTP reason phrase should be "<http-reason-phrase>"
    And the OCS status code should be "<ocs-status>"
    And the OCS status message should be "<ocs-status-message>"
    And the content of file "textfile0.txt" for user "user1" using password "aA1!bB2#cC&deee" should be "ownCloud test text file 0" plus end-of-line
    But user "user1" using password "<password>" should not be able to download file "textfile0.txt"
    Examples:
      | password                       | ocs-api-version | ocs-status | http-status | http-reason-phrase | ocs-status-message                                                                            |
